description: Considered one of James's most difficult works, The sacred fount centers
  on a nameless narrator and his obsessive attempts to discern the love relationships
  between various guests at a weekend getaway in the country, using only their looks
  and behavior. While readers and critics were equally baffled by the book when it
  was published, later critics have more kindly evaluated this experimental work.
